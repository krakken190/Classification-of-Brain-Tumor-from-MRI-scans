# ðŸ§  Classifying Brain Tumors from MRI Scans Using CNNs

This project implements a deep learning pipeline using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify brain MRI scans into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, and Healthy. It aims to support early diagnosis and improve outcomes in brain tumor detection using non-invasive imaging.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

- **Total Images**: 7,023 RGB MRI scans  
- **Classes**:
  - Glioma (1,621 images)
  - Healthy (2,000 images)
  - Meningioma (1,645 images)
  - Pituitary (1,757 images)
- **Image Size**: 224x224  
- **Split**: 80% Train, 10% Validation, 10% Test
